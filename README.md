# Overview
Utilizing wbw201201's "[No Romance Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1529)" mod as its backbone, this updated version includes support for multiplayer, allowing all players in a multiplayer save to experience their own polyamourous romances within the same game session.

This version has worked successfully for updates up to Patch 6, but has _not_ been thoroughly tested. In addition, it is completely untested for Patch 7. All this to say, **use only at your own risk**. This repository is a version updated by myself and for myself, and while it has proven itself functional for me thus far, I cannot guarantee a complete abscence of bugs, especially because I have yet to beat the game. There are points where the console throws errors for reasons I will likely not be debugging, as wbw201201 has confirmed that he will be implementing multiplayer support in future versions of No Romance Limit.

Massive props to [wbw201201](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/wbw201201/mods?gameId=3474) for making the original No Romance Limit mod. Without his hard work, I would never have been able to get this version to where it is today.
