# Overview
Utilizing the backbone of wbw201201's "[No Romance Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1529)" mod, which removes the restriction on the number of romances a player can engage in within Baldur's Gate 3, this updated version includes support for multiplayer in order to allow all players to experience multiple romances simultaneously in the same game session.

This version has worked successfully for updates up to Patch 6, but has _not_ been thoroughly tested. In addition, it is completely untested for Patch 7. All this to say, **use only at your own risk**. There are points where the console throws errors for reasons I will likely not be debugging, as wbw201201 has confirmed that he will be implementing multiplayer support in future versions of No Romance Limit. This was repository is a version updated by myself and for myself.

# Known Issues
- Throws errors during dream visitor scenes. Relationships remain unaffected.
- Occassionally, throws errors upon loading into certain areas. Reasons are unidentified, but relationships remain unaffected.
- Compatibility for Patch 7 is not confirmed.
